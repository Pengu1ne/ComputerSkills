In this folder, I collect exercises from the:
- lectures
- web/online courses

, thus, they have a template which I work on. In addition, some of the exercises are not finished and can cause error messages.

I'll include references, where to find the courses.

Folders:
- ML : machine learning exercises
- Diagrams: focus on matplotlib python library i.e. drawing diagrams
