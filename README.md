----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files in this folder are my own exercises to try different programming techniques and languages and/or what I use and want them to be safe. Usually, I get an idea somewhere else* and start working on that idea. In general, I plan and write the programs here without an existing template.

FOLDER : Exercises
--------------------------------------
A short introduction of each program is at the beginning of the file. If I plan to modify the code, this information is included to this introduction. If needed, more information of the program and/or detailed running instructions are in the file:
nameofprogram_info.txt
-An example: enigma_info.txt

If the program requires a(n input) file (and the file to have a certain structure) the example file is named:
nameofprogram_example.txt, nameofprogram_example.csv, etc.
-An example : enigma_example.txt

Because these are "pet projects" and for fun and growth, I am open for feedback and ideas. So please, leave a comment, send me mail or a message on social media. Contact info on my account page.

*I add reference to the source if applicable.

WIP:
-biljard ball(s) on a table -- idea is to use this model as a basis to model the movement (and interaction) of electrons
-hydrogen atom -- idea is to try out how to program single point energy program

FOLDER : Utility
--------------------------------------
Mainly done by Python and has programs I use to e.g. draw diagrams. Feel free to use/study (and modify) them for your own purposes. I just ask that, please, take your own copy and leave the files in this folder untouched.
