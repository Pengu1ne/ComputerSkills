Files in this folder are my own exercises to try different programming techniques and languages. Usually, I get an idea somewhere else* and start working on that idea. In general, I plan and write the programs here without an existing template. 

A short introduction of each program is at the beginning of the file. If I plan to modify the code, namely it is still work in progress, this information is included to this introduction. If needed, more information of the program and/or detailed running instructions are in the file:
nameofprogram_info.txt
-An example: enigma_info.txt

If the program requires a(n input) file (and the file to have a certain structure) the example file is named:
nameofprogram_example.txt, nameofprogram_example.csv, etc.
-An example : enigma_example.txt

Because these are "pet projects" and for fun and growth, I am open for feedback and ideas. So please, leave a comment, send me mail or a message on social media. Contact info on my account page.

*I add reference to the source if applicable.
